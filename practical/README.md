# The Practical

1. Implement a hierarchical neural network with at least 4 layers.
2. Train the network on CIFAR10
3. Extract a dataset of the network's activations.
4. Perform a PCA on the activations and visulaize how classes are represented across the first 3 PCs
5. Create an RDM for each layer that compares the class representation.
6. Create a hardcoded intuitive RDM with your expectation about similarities between classes.
7. Perform the RSA.
